bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your 
project's KGP 
version is typically 
defined in the 
plugins block of the 
`settings.gradle` 
file (C:\Users\user\M
usic\jos\test7\androi
d/settings.gradle), 
by a plugin with the 
id of org.jetbrains.k
otlin.android. 
If you don't see a 
plugins block, your 
project was likely 
created with an 
older template 
version, in which 
case it is most 
likely defined in 
the top-level 
build.gradle file (C:
\Users\user\Music\jos
\test7\android/build.
gradle) by the 
ext.kotlin_version 
property.
